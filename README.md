## Purpose

This is a **public domain timestamp release** for the mobile version of Chatty. It may fail to run correctly on Android due to platform restrictions â€” but the logic, file structure, and system architecture are complete and verifiable.

No party may claim proprietary ownership of the design, capsule system, or memory structure contained within.
